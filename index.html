                    <div class="mb-0">I was a dedicated competitive swimmer for over 13 years, with 4 of those years being a Division 1 varisty swimmer at the University of Pittsburgh.
                        <br>Throughout these years I have constantly been setting goals and reaching for them with hard work and perserverence.  I learned how to 
                        manage the small amount of time I had as a full-time student-athlete to ensure that set myself up for success outside of the pool.  I acheived success in the pool, training and competing over 20 hours per week,
                        and also in the classroom, where I had a full load of classes in a Computer-Science major.  I graduated with a 3.0 GPA and recieved ACC Academic Honor Role in the 2017-18 season.
                        <br>I was elected as one of the team captains by our coaches for the 2018-19 and 2019-20 seasons, where our team was able to accomplish record setting seasons for Pitt.  
                        <br>I was a part of multiple school-record relays all four years at Pitt, a multi-event finalist at the ACC Championships four years in a row, as well as a 2020 Olympic Trials qualifier in the 200m butterfly.
